            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, I'm Zach! I'm a junior student at Portland State University
              pursuing a Computer Science degree with a keen interest in DevOps
              and Backend Engineering. I am fascinated by the process of
              automating software development, deployment, and infrastructure
              management.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to DevOps, I am deeply passionate about Backend
              Engineering. I enjoy working on the server-side of applications,
              designing efficient and scalable systems, and implementing robust
              APIs. Building the foundation and ensuring smooth data flow in an
              application is what drives my enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from my keen interest in technology, I am also deeply
              immersed in music. I enjoy playing many instruments; at present,
              my focus and obsession revolve around two areas: modular synthesis
              and programming rhythm machines. Over the years, I have dedicated
              myself to writing, recording, and performing original music as a
              solo artist and with various bands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, I live in the beautiful city of Portland with my wife
              and our dog Frances (as seen in the picture). Originally from the
              Midwest, I have found my home and deep appreciation for life in
              the Pacific Northwest. I live for morning coffee, spicy foods,
              good sci-fi, and spending quality time with friends and family.
